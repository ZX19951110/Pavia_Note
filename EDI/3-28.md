## architectural models
cls

* server centric & control provider

plp

* decentralized & control community

Networked applications -> distributed -> components on != system

process1 communicate process2 (diff systems)

**identification**

* identify of process: unique 
* addressing identification of the system (IP address)
* identification of specific process(port number)
* pair = IPaddress:port (uniquely identify of process on system)

**Port Numbers**

some reserved used by specific applications: (80: web)

##Transport layer protocols

choice depends on application requirements

wish list: best mapping between requirements & protocol characterment

app requirements: QoS attubutes: reliability performance security

Reliability: refer to datatransfer

two categories: 

1. 100% reliablity: no data loss
2. Tolerant to some data loss

Performance

* throughput(吞吐量): rate at which sending process can send data to receiving process
* avilable bandwidth(带宽) between sendng receiving processes
* elastic(弹) adapt to avaliable bandwidth
* Timing: End to End delay: level of interactivity

VOIP: voice encoded 32 kbps

Security: Guarantee provacy/confidentiality

# TCP & UDP

**TCP**

Connection oriented protocol(three way handshaking)

full duplex(双工)

flow/congrstion control mechanisms

**UDP**

no concept of connection

no full duplex

no flow congrstion（拥塞）

**TCP VS UDP**

Reliability: Yes, No

Min bandiwidth: No, No

Max End to end delay: No, No

Security: Basic No(But SSL), No

UDP is fast (Light Protocol)

---
Multimedia applications -> UDP = switching to tcp => routers/firewalls block udp picks

## Application Layer protocols

Specify interaction between procss and communicate

Type & format of use actions/rules associated with use

Two categories of protocols

open protocols -> known specifications

* standard documents by drganizations -> IETF (internet engineeringtask force)
	* very good for interoperation

proprietary protocols = closed for choice

## web technologies

basis on networked applications => websites terminology

File uniquely identified by a URL

## URL

uniform resource locator

Protocol://hostname:port/pathname/object?parameters


starting from document root

Server side HW = machine stores the website & runs sw comp

SW = server component of C/S application

Webserver -> Apache...

http: hyper text transfer protocol

application layer

#HTTP

http1.0

* http1.1 RFCs->2014major version
* http2 -> RFCs ->2015 RFCs

**Handshaking SYN->SYNACK->ACK**

## Time

Download time = object size & available bandwidth

RTT = 10ms

Time = 1RTT+1RTT+download time(pagesize/bandwidth)
