## Trustworthiness

trust

* user trust providers => data stored managed
* privay/confidentiality & data integrity & security

machines for access control

HTTP headers

Authorization: basic content

Apache .htaccess

Authentication type: 

* Basic -> simple & supported by browsers (basic=basic64,very weak)(should not used on unsecure channels)
* sophisticated -> stronger

## How to make a communcation channel secure?

**HTTPS**

HTTP OVER SSL (PORT 443)

**HTTP VS HTTPS**

HTTPS: Payent websites, transport confidential data, keep communication & identity & broswer private.

Obstacles against https adoption:

* technological -> old technologies might not support sopmisticated encryption mechanistli
* political -> government "analyze" traffic https -> downgraded to http.
* economic -> organizaions might not have resources for https

HTTPS Cache: 

* Browser cache: yes, proxy cache: No

**SSL**

SSL => Secure Socket Layer => at application

TLS => Transport Layer Security(standard of SSL)

TLS/SSL => security mechanisms for end to end communications

NO SSL => pocess->tcp socket->tcp->ip

USE SSL => process->SSL socket->SSL sublayer->tcp socket->TCP->IP

end to end: Three way handshaking(tcp)
SSL handshaking=>exchange information to establish a secure connection

key generation/exchange

data transfer

tcp connection closed by server

https-is longer with ssl because of set up

**http/2**

since2015 may http/1.x

no changes in definiations/use of methods status codes-header lines
majority of websites not support http/2

tuned/customized for http/1.x

migration to http/2 complex &expensive in tertls of resources

a decade-wider deployment of http/2

benefits of http/2:

http request message break in three stream(frame)

frame type- type of content/purpose

(headers, data)

http1:

* c-s: t1 req, t2 res

http2:

* c-s: 同时发送req res

1. multiplexing: 并发请求
2. single tcp connection
3. binary: frame containing binary information(faster to parse, more reliable, accurate)
4. header compression 
5. server push: content sent by server before the client request
