## Measure against security threats

1. Encryption => strong measure
	1. data are encrypted（加密）
		1. sensitive data enctypted to avoid data breaches
		2. Mobile devices to protect in case of loss
	2. communications are encrypted => Eavesdropping(窃听)
	3. Can not be understood by strangers
	4. http not encrypted
	5. https encrypted

2. Authentication/authorization mechanishs
	1. OBJ => to restrict(限制) access to authorized users
	2. authentication => explicit mechanism with user internention control
* Two Steps authentication
	1. Password chosen by user
	2. otp = one time password
	3. Implicit mechanish under provider control
		1. **MAC Address** => Unique ID for devices
		2. Ip Address

**Choice of Passwords => Security attacks againsts passwords**

* Capture PWD associated with account
	* Password enforcement(强制) policy
		* Rules for PWDS chosen by users
		* Avoid Using Same PWD across services
* Security Attacks -> DDOS -> Symptoms(症状) of DDos
	* Monitor/measure traffic & load
	* understand a DDos a hack difficult
		* Requests is very large
			* flash crowd(突发访问)
			* slash dots
	* Specialize HW/SW tools and firewalls
		* IPS = intursion prevention system
			* Measure traffic/load for anomalies/exploits & discard traffic before itreaches target
		* IDS = Intursion detection system
			* To detect DDOS byy analyzing traffic patierns
			 & Create alerts to system admin
* Fire Walls => technologies
	* Filter traffic & separate traffic(分离流量) (Internal & External)
	* Internal Firewall avoid discosure data

* Direct cost of security

	* SW products to implement security
	* Infrastructure that deploy the secrity products
		* Cope with product requirements
		
	* Personal = security experts
* Indirect cost of security
	* consequence(后果) of security incidents
		* Business loss
		* Reputation(声誉) loss
* Response plans against security attacks
	* Role/responsibilities(Who does what)
	* Mitigation(缓和) plans
