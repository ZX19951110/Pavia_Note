## Reliability & Availability & Durability

Availability -> Property

Heasures-> Is Reachable & Works Properly

2 States

* Working = Avaliable = up & Running
* Not working = Not Available = Down

**Availiability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)**

**0<Availiability<1, 100% Availiability = Ideal Case (7\*24) (Unrealistic)**

Impact of Unavailability (Very Subjective)

* Addicted to services/online
* Provider -> Loss revenues & Reputation

2 Types of Unavailability

* Scheduled Downtimes (Planned)
	* Maintenance & Updates HW/SW
	* Minimize Downtimes
	* Properly Announce(When & Why & How long)
	* Properly Select The Time of Unavailability => off peak (Less Traffic) = Min Number of Users
	* **Mitigation Plan => Propose Alternative solution to users(Divert users to call center)**
* Unscheduled Downtimes(Not Planned)
	* Caused By External Events
		* Security Attack
		* Power Outage
		* Failures
		* SW Bugs
		* Human Errors
	* Inform Customer In a Timely Manner of What Happened
		* Social Media
		* Status Page
	* Build the User Confidence
		* Ensure Users are Seriously Working on the Problem

**Availability => Max Availability**

* Improve reliability of the Components
	* Components works as Expected
	* Robust/Fault Tolerant components(容错组件)

* Prevent Events That Can Cause Downtime

**Reliability Metrics**

* MTBF = Mean time Between Failures
	* MTBF for HardDisk = 1.2M hours
* AFR = Annualized Failure Rate Fraction offailures/year

* MTTR = Mean Time To Repair(min)

Fault Tolerance => Redundancy & Replications

* Redundancy = Physical Components
* Replications = Data

Power Outage

* Ups = Uninterruptable Power Supply

Storage Components

* 分布式储存
* **RAID Architecture**(磁盘阵列)(考过)(磁盘镜像容灾)

**Trust worthiness = Worth of Trust/Confidence**

Protect data, devices & infrastructure

User Confident that nothing happened

Visit of website is not malware infection

Clicking link is not Nopersonal data disclosure & Lost mones

**Security Threats/attacks**

Objective: To make Services/infrastructure down

1. Infrastructure/security
2. Distributed Denial of service attack(DDOS)

How Attack works

1. Very Many Devices used in ddos = Collected of infected/comprotused devices

2. Send requests/Traffic by Flooding

Impact

1. Negative effects on providers economic losses & reputation losses

Cause

1. Devices are not properly configured = Easy to be compromised

Dufficult to detect

* Halicious Taffic
* Legitimate Traffic
* Data(Protect data => Ensure privacy & confidentiacity)(Sensitive)
	* Personal Identified Information
	* Sensitive Business Data
		* Unintentional Data Disclouse
