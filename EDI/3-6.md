# Enterprise digital infrastructure
---
## Technological(SW/HW) & non technologcal components (environment) used to deploy services/application

### Technological components

* hardware
	* server
	* storage system
	* offline backup systems
* software
	* operating system
	* DBMS
	* security products
	* appliction software
* communication
	* routers
	* switches
	* fibers
	* satellites
	* antennas

### Non technological components

* **Data center**
	* ENI Greendata center(company)
	* SuperNAP(company)
* server racks
* Fire alarms
* Electric infrastructure
* cooling system

## Choice of the compoents

**challenge**

* which/how many/how big
* Ingredients->known
* Recipe->not known

**computer components**

* Fan
* processor
	* i7
* RAM
	* >=8GB
* Storage
	* 512GB SSD
	* 1TB HardDisk
* Master board

**business world -> Intuition(直觉) does not work**

* two contradictory(矛盾) requirements
	* quality/efficiency -> Infrastructure satisfies service requirements & User expectations
	* deploy more compoonents than needed (expensive)
	* Competitiveness -> minimize the cost
		* deploy infrastructure to offer service at min cost
	* less components than needed(cheap)
	
Load of the infrastructure

* Over Provisioning quality good(昂贵：平均读取在最高点，产生资源浪费)
* Under provisioning negative impact on quality（便宜：平均读取在曲线中间）

**COST**

* TCO(Total Cost of Ownership)
	* cost for buy or rent or equipment
	* Maintennance
	* Personnel
		* Salary
		* Training Covrses
*  Cloud environments
	*  Upfront(前期) cost avoided
	*  Pay per user model

Additional challenges faced 2 Provoders

* Services on Demand(Users use the service at any time/whenever they want) 
	* Providers do not know how many uers will simultaneously(同时) use the service (and when)

* Network Effect

	* Social behavior -> User align to the behavior of the other
	* Popularity of Aservice
		* number of users
		* number of services
	* Big increase of load/traffic(negative impact on quality)
	* Flash crowd(External events)
	* Huge peak of load that lasts for short time
		* Slash Dot on small websites becomes suddendly very popular
* Composition of Services(Mashup) = Providers do not have full control
	* Multiple interconnected components

* LBS = Location Based Services
	* Behavior change according to location,provider not know who/how many 
* Cloud environment/Geographically distributedon
	* delays
	* virtualization
	* Difficult for providers to control

## Porperties/Requirements of services

**2 Capabilities**

1. ceneral properties

	* Interoperasility = Ability of a service to work/looperate with other services
		* stardard technologies
	* Scalability = Ability to adapt to requests
	* Flexibility = Ability to follow execution paths

2. Qos = Quality of Service
	* Properties
		* Behavior of Service
		* User Experence
	* 3 Main attributes
		1. Dependability
			1. Reliability(Availability,Durability)
			2. Trustworthiness(Privacy,confidentiality,security)
		2. Performance
		3. Usability
		
## Subjective Attributes

Personal perception

* Users
	* Type of user
	* Skill of user
		* Expert user
		* Novice(初学者) user

* Service
	* Type of service
	* Interactivity level
	* Timing requirement
		* real time
		* Faster is better
		
Patience (Abality to wait for something without being annoyed)

* 1s User focused on the task
* 10s Limit to keep user focused
* >10s User shifted

57% of mobile user leave a service

### Usability

1. Efficiency
2. Efficacy
