4. Distributed DB

1st core feature 

distributed DB

Geographicallly distributed ns

hierarchical organization -> what to distribute/where

## Centralized solution

centralized solution + easy to implement & use

reliability = service working as planned

* bad -> single point of failure

performance/efficiency => "long" lookup phases

* bad -> latency/delays + heavy traffic + increased probability of pkt loss
